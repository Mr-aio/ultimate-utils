# Ultimate Utils for Theorem proving 

This is where the common code for Brando's ML for Theorem Proving (ML4TP) will go. 

## Ideas

Ideas of what could go here:
- An Eval Env for ITP with a solid prover
  - task 1:
    - Prover = Thor, Draft Sketch Prove (DSP), etc.
    - Prover + LLM (our own)
    - Prover (our own) + LLM (our own)
    - MiniF2F (Isabella, PISA) + prover + model (likely best/small debug)
- Data extraction tools?
