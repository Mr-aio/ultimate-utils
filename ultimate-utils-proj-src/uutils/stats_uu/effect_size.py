Effect size = is a quantative measure of the strength of a phenomenon. Effect size emphasizes the size of the difference
    or relationship. e.g. the distance between the two means of two hyptoehsis H0, H1 (if they were Gaussian distributions).

Remark: It's important to note that effect size seems to be a function of the application (todo: why)

note:
    - you usually look up the effect size in you application/field (todo why)
    - depends on statistical test/hypothesis decision procedure (e.g. t-test, ANOVA, etc.).
    - large is good if you get a large effect size.
    - Q: why can't we control the effect size? (todo why) I think it's just a function of field/nature & your hypothesis
    - Q: how does it relate to number of samples? does it lead to the issues CIs lead e.g. Pf -> 1 Pm->0?
    - Courtney says, if the effect size is large, then a smaler sample size is needed. My guess is that n (sample size)
    should not affect negatively the effect size.
    - if effect size is small, then a larger sample size is needed (Courney says) (todo: why?)
