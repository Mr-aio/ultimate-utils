Improve my scientific title for a NeurIPS NIPs ICML ICLR machine learning publication (maximizing impact): 
```markdown
%current title
\title{Re-evaluating Meta-Learning versus Pre-training: An In-depth Empirical Examination Reveals Marginal Differences between MAML and Pre-trained Models}
Is Pre-training really better than Meta-learning? An In-depth Empirical Examination Reveals Marginal Differences between MAML and Pre-trained Models 
```
It should be of top quality for a NeurIPS NIPs ICML ICLR machine learning publication
(do not change citations e.g. \citep{...}, urls or names).
Also, do not change any part that is already excellent.
Do not sound exaggerated or pompous.
Keep it concise, scientific, use the active voice.
Should be impactful and maybe catchy, controversial, or surprising or interesting -- yet short and accurate factual.

Curious guys, how do you use capital letters for titles? e.g. what do you think of this 

\subsection{Method 1: Chose top K Sequences of Highest Quality for Pre-training or Fine-tuning}

The use of capital letters in titles is generally dictated by the style guide you are using. In English, there are several major style guides, such as the APA (American Psychological Association), MLA (Modern Language Association), and Chicago Manual of Style. The specific rules can vary between these style guides.

However, in the example you provided, which seems to be in an academic or professional context, you would generally follow APA or Chicago style, which use a method called "title case" or "headline style."

In title case, the following rules are applied:

Capitalize the first and last words of the title, no matter what they are.
Capitalize all major words in the title, including nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and some conjunctions.
Lowercase articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, for, nor), and prepositions, regardless of length, unless they are the first or last word of the title.
Lowercase the 'to' in an infinitive.
So your title would be transformed to:

\subsection{Method 1: Choose Top K Sequences of Highest Quality for Pre-Training or Fine-Tuning}

In this corrected title:

'Choose,' 'Top,' 'Sequences,' 'Highest,' 'Quality,' 'Pre-Training,' and 'Fine-Tuning' are all capitalized as they are either the first word, major words, or the last word of the title or its subtitle.
'of,' 'for,' and 'or' are not capitalized as they are prepositions or coordinating conjunctions.
There was a typo in the original version, where 'Chose' should be 'Choose.'
