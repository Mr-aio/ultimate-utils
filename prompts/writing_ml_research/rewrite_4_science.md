Provide me with different re-writes of the scientific text in quotations.
Remain professional, concise, scientifically sounding, persuasive yet simple, use the active voice:
```text
> We hypothesize no fine-tuning overestimate diversity because when the backbone is not fine-tuned the task2vec embeddings are not grounded in the same dataset yet. But when the backbone is fine-tuned then the model is adjusted to a more similar distribution -- given that although the batches are different, they condition on the same dataset. Leading to fine tuning to have a lower variation on average.

I have a couple of different phrasing for a sentence in a scientific paper I am writing in the quotes bellow.
I would like more re-phrasing options:
```text
Option 1: 
We propose to start discussion of data diversity as a metric of data quality, measuring task coverage.

Option 2:
We pioneer discussion on quantitative metrics of data quality by examining task coverage via the concrete measure of the diversity coefficient.
