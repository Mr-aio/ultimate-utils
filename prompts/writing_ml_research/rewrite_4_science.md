-	One of the reasons humans are so effective at learning programming and mathematics is that they learn beyond pattern recognition. They are able to build intuitive high level models that capture relationships and similarity between concepts. In particular, these high level models and rules are difficult to formally specify in traditional handcrafted systems. Instead, a learning system learns these from the partial proof term data we mine and it is able to do high level proof steps by sketching partial proof terms.

I have a couple of different phrasing for a sentence in a scientific paper I am writing in the quotes bellow.
I would like more re-phrasing options:
```text
Option 1: 
We propose to start discussion of data diversity as a metric of data quality, measuring task coverage.

Option 2:
We pioneer discussion on quantitative metrics of data quality by examining task coverage via the concrete measure of the diversity coefficient.
