\textbf{Why and when does diversity matter?}
We conjecture two main reasons why diversity matters and explain our rationale:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Conjecture 1: Diversity matters because it enables learning-to-learn (proxy for General Intelligence).}
    This is the main conjecture we provide evidence in this paper. 
    The main argument is that if there is high diversity, it means there are many tasks in the dataset.
    Therefore, for the model to do well, it has to do well on all tasks.
    One way to do it is by learning-to-learn and therefore transfer when challenged with solving a new task. 
    An alternative would be memorizing all the tasks. 
    \item \textbf{Conjecture 2: Diversity matters because it increases changes that training set covers test set.}
    Diversity is a formalization of coverage -- it aims to be the effective (average) number of tasks in a dataset.
    Therefore, the higher the diversity, the more tasks a dataset has.
    This (might) increase the probability that the training set covers the test set and improves performance.
    This exploration of this conjecture is left for future work. 
\end{enumerate}

"""
I have a couple of different phrasing for a sentence in a scientific paper I am writing in the quotes bellow.
I would like more re-phrasing options:
```text
Option 1: 
We propose to start discussion of data diversity as a metric of data quality, measuring task coverage.

Option 2:
We pioneer discussion on quantitative metrics of data quality by examining task coverage via the concrete measure of the diversity coefficient.
