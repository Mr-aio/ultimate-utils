# Prompt: create excellent captions
Rewrite my caption notes into a top scientific machine learning caption:
```text
My caption notes:
  \caption{\textbf{Distribution of pairwise task distances from concatenation of five sub-datasets of The Pile.} Distribution of distances shows multi-modal distribution (left). Distribution of pairwise distance is segmented by datasets that batches are sourced from where each sub-distribution corresponds to a mode (right). Dotted lines denote the diversity coefficient. These results show that combining batches from two different datasets computes a higher diversity. This aligns with our expectation that combining datasets from different sources increases the overall data diversity.}

Top caption example:
Table 1: \textbf{Freezing successive layers (preventing inner loop adaptation) does not affect accuracy, supporting 
feature reuse.} 
To test the amount of feature reuse happening in the inner loop adaptation, we test the
accuracy of the model when we freeze (prevent inner loop adaptation) a contiguous block of layers at test time.
We find that freezing even all four convolutional layers of the network (all layers except the network head) hardly
affects accuracy. 
This strongly supports the feature reuse hypothesis: layers donâ€™t have to change rapidly at
adaptation time; they already contain good features from the meta-initialization.

Figure 2: High CCA/CKA similarity between representations before and after adaptation for all layers
except the head. We compute CCA/CKA similarity between the representation of a layer before the inner loop
adaptation and after adaptation. We observe that for all layers except the head, the CCA/CKA similarity is
almost 1, indicating perfect similarity. This suggests that these layers do not change much during adaptation, but
mostly perform feature reuse. Note that there is a slight dip in similarity in the higher conv layers (e.g. conv3,
conv4); this is likely because the slight representational differences in conv1, conv2 have a compounding effect
on the representations of conv3, conv4. The head of the network must change significantly during adaptation,
and this is reflected in the much lower CCA/CKA similarity.

General outline of a great scientific caption:
\textbf{Bold the Main Contribution or Point or Conclusion of the figures.} 
Then some none bold text describing some details or explaining a little more concisely.
```
Your caption for the figure should be of top quality for a NeurIPS NIPs ICML ICLR AAAI machine learning publication
(do not change citations e.g. \citep{...}, urls or names).
Do not copy the facts but the style of the top caption example I provided.
Also, do not change any part that is already excellent.
Do not sound exaggerated or pompous.
Keep it concise, scientific, direct, use the active voice.
