# ---- Negotiations ---- 
Note: current notes are very rough. Need to do some heavy organizing. Take everything written witha grain of salt. 

# Do not engage in Salary conversation if you do not know your Role/Level
Always be:
```
- Be Respectful
- non-defensive not accusatory (e.g., )
- Do not be judgmental e.g., X is a bad offer
- Do not argue or make your case
- Keep the relationship warm
- Do not make assuptions
- Treat negotiations as a common hurdle/challenge to resolve as a team
- Help me overcome your limitation, let me help you
- Whenever appropriate ( )
```
The following conversation is a sample script of how to respectfully yet firmly decline to negotiate a salary when both of you are not ready:

# -- Collection of nice phrases
It's important to carry on the positive relationship that you built in the interview phase (or collaboration phase), to negotiation phase. 

Phrases:
- word/phrase switch: `negotiate --> discuss`
- word/phrase switch: `raise salary --> adjust salary` (e.g., don't make it feel your taking from them)
- word/phrase switch: `adjust offer` 
- word/phrase switch: `I'm sorry I can't accept 80K base salary --> I'm excited for the team and enjoyed meeting everyone. In terms of total compensation, I'm looking for something closer to 250k. Would you be open to a base salary of $160K? (or whatever the # is for your uppoer band for your role, if you identify yourself as a top performer).`
- word/phrase switch: `I can't do X --> I don't think I can do at the current level -- 250k tot comp is what I need to be able to sign. Can you be more flexible somewhere else, e.g., Equity? What about 20K for equiaty and the rest signing bonus -- that would get us to $250K. ... reply tough but I will see what I can do ... -> Ok I understand. I'm ready to sign if we can get to that number.`

Soft considerations:
- Keep relationship warm
- Empathy:
    - Acknowledge their efforts
    - Be grateful

Heuristics
- Stick to respectfully but firmly to your total compensation

- TODO: understand IP and limitations after leaving morph is.

Common Counters from Recruiters/Hiring Managers:
- Economy is bad
- This is the best we can offer, since this is a fairly junior role

Typical right now
    - 4 year vesting, 1 year cliff to give you 1/4 of your equity
    - 0.5 - 1% typical equity for founding/1st software engineer/applied scientist

TODOs:
- phrase, I'd like to clarify/understand/help why the offer is so low
- " ", I'd like to clarify how the publications will work, especially wrt my thesis
- offer is pretty bad --> 
- be grateful for the offer and show excimenent
- you need to arrive at a proposal that you'd agree to if offered
- they don't care about your costs, just the value you provide for them
- So I assume I should explicitly yet respectfully ask why is the offer so low. perhaps a modification of your offer to them that augments what you think they want to help you get what you want.
- you are rushing me --> `this is a big ask, that is comming to quickly, and it's my 1st job coming out of academia. I need to understand things`

- SK good comments
    - good for you to calibrate on how much your joining them might change their outcome i.e., will it take them longer without you, or is there some special IP, or skillset you have that is hard to hire for in the open market?
    - (also, do you think it's ok to ask them questions on writing?) Always ok to try to get things in writing. They will ask for a meeting if they dont want to put things in writing... Sometimes this is informative
    - In the end, everyone is optimizing for self interest. good for you to calibrate on how much your joining them might change their outcome i.e., will it take them longer without you, or is there some special IP, or skillset you have that is hard to hire for in the open market?
    - Can be useful to try and see things from their perspective to better understand the value proposition, and perhaps a modification of your offer to them that augments what you think they want to help you get what you want.
        - hence the call to self-reclection. So its goos to not just think oif your passion, but how they as a company in the space, and a potential competitior (if you choose not to work with them) might view things
esp since the space is specialized and narrower than the rest of the field

- Pedro good advice -- understand value proposition, your role and why they need you
    - when the offer is not competitive according to the market (or your own feelings of how good you are relative to the market, go for upper band always once role & contributions are agreed upon/clear), then try to understand 
        - 1. your role in the company
        - 2. why the gap exists (with the median or the top band of the level you feel you can deliver at)
    - understand the gap
    - what is my role and what is the median
    - no point in doing a 180k counter offer when their lower offer is already super low (1/2 of the lowest band for the role you think matches your skills)
    - (not sure if this is true, need to read contract + non-compete laws but I have this on my notes from yesterday: First, thank you for the offer and I'm excited for the project, enjoyed meeting the team & company's vision. In terms of total compensation I'm looking for something closer to at least the median 340K, though I consider myself a top perfomer (median, but you should always negotiate upper band but in my case the offer is so low that perhaps upper band is too aggressive or perhaps just saying a straight no, but actually discussing & understanding hap is a better step but for the sake of writing something here we go). Would you be open for a base salary of 160K -- note this is still median and I am a top performer (still median, not upper band, not condor's advice))? I know this might seem high, especially given the initial offer, but these are the median numbers in the tech industry. 
        - Given RS non compete, do you think you're actually losing a lot of freedom?
            - already know I can do whatever I want in free time. Div/Dq/Alg (ok) is not a problem
            - but what about projects already in ML4Maths/Autoform
                - MAF, AF ft
                - other similar projs that might arise
            - am I really losing freedom given non compete RS sent
                - don't understand how trade secret interacts with above
                - I'd assume Ari's research is a trade secret but he is at a start up...?!
        - TODO: rephrase, tot comp is not enough to value I'd be bringing + market values 
        - TODO what impact would you bring? (unique skills, great software eng, data pipeline unique + expesnive)

- IP & thesis interaction
    - SK
        - TODO
    - Jesse
        - can't put it on paper, but it's in his benefit to publish. He has high standard (good!). 

- Numbers
    - divs: 120-180K base, 0.5%-1% equity range software engineer/applied scientists. 
        - median:
            - 150k (but aipaygrades says 160K is base for big tech https://aipaygrad.es/) 
            - 0.5% equity (4 year vesting 1 year cliff)
            - it's full time, not contractor. 

Process:
- First, delay salary conversations until **both** of you are convinced this is the right job. 
    - Never ever share your previous salary.
    - They can still ask salary expectations at this stage (trying to figure out if you guys are right fit).
    - Politely & respectfully, yet firmly say you don't know or are not comfortable sharing at this stage. Repeat 3 times if needed. People will not ask for a 4th, 5th time once you already said no. 
    - Don't be afraid to stand your ground.
    - TODO: write sample of how to stand your ground in case of asked to give salary expectations when you're not ready. 
- One you guys know you are good fit,
    - share your excitment about the new job BUT, control every urge to
        - overly show excitment
        - react to the numbers
        - share your previous salary
        - arguing or trying to make your case
        - don't act surprised or let it come across
- 

Tips:
- do not be defensive
- do not acuse them or make assumptions if you do not like the offer
- They are legally required to give salary band if asked
- if you do say a number, always use objective market values e.g.,
    - X is half the median base salary for level Y

TODO: read poker face theorem, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_poker

- CS Stanford has 1 year limit of sabatial leave of absence
- friends that are VC their thoughts can help guage value of start up comapnies you join
    - e.g., crash mentioned to always have it clear what their revenue plan is
- help them help you, be creative e.g., more frequent performance evals, helping them get seed funding, producing business models, revenue ideas
- who's compute (premises, resources) we use determines IP
- why does it matter who owns IP? (TODO)
- you can always put in the acknowledgment + first page "work done with at morph/ibm/google etc"

- fellowship (?)

- 50% CA/RA stanford (20h/w)
    - Jay wasn't clear but I assume the reamining 40% is whatever I want e.g., I am a student
    - I assume never 100% to avoid benefits/tax issues? (university wide hack/loop hole, doesn't seem nice)
- summer
    - 50 - 90
- total
    - 50k tuition
    - 5k health insurance
    - 30k stipend (36-40/h)

## Exploding Offer, Tight Deadlines

If you're told the offer has a hard deadline (an “exploding offer”)

Sometimes a tight deadline is legitimate but often it’s a mechanism to prevent you from looking around too much. “Exploding offers” are a bad industry practice and unfortunately very common with new grad offers, where companies are trying to lock down candidates before everyone else.

Here’s a secret: if you renege on a signed job offer, nothing bad will happen. You might get told it’ll ruin your reputation, but especially in a large company, you'll be fine.

You’re going to dedicate years of your productive life to an organisation, it’s perfectly reasonable to make the best decision for you. Don’t sign an offer you intend to renege on, but especially in face of questionable ethical behavior, don’t feel bad if you have to walk it back.

# Thoughts to Clean Up

## The general thought process on messaging people from Sim

So here is **the general thought process I use when working on messaging people**. The first and most important is what is this message going to tell her about you, is it a favorable to your end goal or not. With this in mind I then go through the profile. If possible I will try and use any context clues about her. So for instance, what is she wearing, what shoes, hair, what does her style tell me about her. Where is she in the photos, does what’s in the photos match what is going on  in the bio. Who else is in the pictures. What is she emphasizing in here bio? Are there things she is speaking about that I also am interested in? After going through the bio this is when I start plotting out the iceburgh. This is how I set my pace from one convo to another. I will normally try and formulate anchor points to help keep the conversation moving as I go through questions in order. The goal is to try and cover my anchors over 3 days and if things are going well and the stream of communication is consistent, that is when I ask for the date. I also try and use poetic language if I can. Important to note, you want the messages to come off as conversational and not an interview. I always try and position as the safe place to come chat.
