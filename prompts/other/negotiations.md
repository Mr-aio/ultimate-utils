# ---- Negotiations ---- 



# -- Collection of nice phrases
It's important to carry on the positive relationship that you built in the interview phase (or collaboration phase), to negotiation phase. 

Phrases:
- word/phrase switch: `negotiate --> discuss`
- word/phrase switch: `raise salary --> adjust salary` (e.g., don't make it feel your taking from them)
- word/phrase switch: `adjust offer` 


TODOs:
- phrase, I'd like to clarify/understand/help why the offer is so low
- " ", I'd like to clarify how the publications will work, especially wrt my thesis
- offer is pretty bad --> 
- be grateful for the offer and show excimenent
- you need to arrive at a proposal that you'd agree to if offered
- they don't care about your costs, just the value you provide for them
- So I assume I should explicitly yet respectfully ask why is the offer so low. perhaps a modification of your offer to them that augments what you think they want to help you get what you want.
- you are rushing me --> `this is a big ask, that is comming to quickly, and it's my 1st job coming out of academia. I need to understand things`

- SK good comments
    - good for you to calibrate on how much your joining them might change their outcome i.e., will it take them longer without you, or is there some special IP, or skillset you have that is hard to hire for in the open market?
    - Brando — Yesterday at 7:11 PM
(also, do you think it's ok to ask them questions on writing?)
Always ok to try to get things in writing. They will ask for a meeting if they dont want to put things in writing... Sometimes this is informative
    - In the end, everyone is optimizing for self interest. good for you to calibrate on how much your joining them might change their outcome i.e., will it take them longer without you, or is there some special IP, or skillset you have that is hard to hire for in the open market?

- IP & thesis interaction

Process:
- First, delay salary conversations until **both** of you are convinced this is the right job. 
    - Never ever share your previous salary.
    - They can still ask salary expectations at this stage (trying to figure out if you guys are right fit).
    - Politely & respectfully, yet firmly say you don't know or are not comfortable sharing at this stage. Repeat 3 times if needed. People will not ask for a 4th, 5th time once you already said no. 
    - Don't be afraid to stand your ground.
    - TODO: write sample of how to stand your ground in case of asked to give salary expectations when you're not ready. 
- One you guys know you are good fit,
    - share your excitment about the new job BUT, control every urge to
        - overly show excitment
        - react to the numbers
        - share your previous salary
        - arguing or trying to make your case
        - don't act surprised or let it come across
- 

Tips:
- do not be defensive
- do not acuse them or make assumptions if you do not like the offer
- They are legally required to give salary band if asked

# Thoughts to Clean Up

## The general thought process on messaging people from Sim

So here is **the general thought process I use when working on messaging people**. The first and most important is what is this message going to tell her about you, is it a favorable to your end goal or not. With this in mind I then go through the profile. If possible I will try and use any context clues about her. So for instance, what is she wearing, what shoes, hair, what does her style tell me about her. Where is she in the photos, does what’s in the photos match what is going on  in the bio. Who else is in the pictures. What is she emphasizing in here bio? Are there things she is speaking about that I also am interested in? After going through the bio this is when I start plotting out the iceburgh. This is how I set my pace from one convo to another. I will normally try and formulate anchor points to help keep the conversation moving as I go through questions in order. The goal is to try and cover my anchors over 3 days and if things are going well and the stream of communication is consistent, that is when I ask for the date. I also try and use poetic language if I can. Important to note, you want the messages to come off as conversational and not an interview. I always try and position as the safe place to come chat.
