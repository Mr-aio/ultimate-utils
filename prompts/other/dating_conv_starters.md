[//]: # (My attempted openers or ideas)
Hi Ala, I'm reading altered-trait, a science meditation book and thought about you. Do you ever take mindfulness walks in the forest/nature? What is your favorite way to recharge?
# Another attempt by me 
Hi Angela!
I read the blurb about "the untethered soul", I really like the premise! I am in the process of reading "Altered Traits", a book about "Transformative Changes to the mind and body" through meditation.
Curious, what lessons do you think have been most pertinent in the text?
My priority in life is to live a meaningful, intentional life, so I am always curious about books in the genre.
```
The message should engage the women, especially start the conversation positively. 
It should not be: needy, overly exaggerated, pompous, confrontational or shallow.
It is fine if it's funny, witty, flirty (without overdoing it) yet mature and shows I'm a
stable independent man that is high value.
But most important is that it follow the iceberg or triangle approach to getting to know someone,
i.e. the message I write to her is connected to something about her in her profile, and ideally
invites us to get to know each other more -- especially making her feel implicitly that we like 
each other more and more as we get to know each other more.
This latter part is done because we wrote something connected to her profile. 
Also respect my guidelines and use my current attempts and ideas 
-- since that would ideally connect to things we might have in common. 
Connecting at a values level and having fun being lightweight or lighthearted or relaxed tone.
Look for parts in her profile that mention "brownie points for X" or "I geek out for Books/Travel".
It means she is likely to respond and talk about that topic. 
Make sure that topic is an inceberg so you can develop a connection with her.
Reference things that she might know and relevant e.g.,
"Would it be similar like when Gandi said/did X".
Be nuanced and notice little things or what is going on e.g., in what she likes, her profile, etc (why?).
Do not compliment her in ways that sounds needy, be casual and relaxed, grounded.
If there is something about books choose it, most guys don't read.
You do read, so try to connect with her in that topic.
It is also important that it's not too long, ideally concise and short, yet good.
It has to be 1 or 2 sentences -- max 3 sentences. 
Write my an interesting opener for her in Hinge, Bumble, Coffee and Beagles.

# Prompt2: How to ask simple questions into unique deeper enticing questions that raise interest
I want to translate a mundane question into a deep question, that raises the interest in me from the person (women) receiving my message.
To make it enticing and motivate a reponse from her -- it should help her realize or learn something about herself or about you, ideally about common values or interests.
Example translations:
```
General Format:
> instead of: mudane question --> instead ask --> deep question that raises her interest in you
Examples:
> instead of: what's your favorite book -->  instead ask --> what traits do your top 5 books have in common
> instead of: what is your favorite place to travel -->  instead ask --> what draws you to nations around the world
> instead of: what is your favorite colour --> instead ask --> what is unique about the feeling that you get about your favorite colour
> instead of: what's your favorite food --> instead ask --> what is the way that you feel when eating your favorite food that is different from other foods
```
Don't ask her a basic question, follow the technique above where you raise her interest, and have her have fun.
To raise her interest, have her associate her with things about me that we have in common, ideally values. 
Write a message so that she is curious about me -- (good) mystery is good.
This is my current question:
```
Current conversation & response, or context:
nothing... 

Question to rephrase
> instead of:
Is the reason you also love sleeping at 10 pm, despite being called a grandpa/ma by friends, cuz you prioritize taking advantage of your day to push yourself to grow daily?
--> insterad ask --> ?
```
Help me translate it to make raise her interest and entice a response.
It shouldn't be pompous, exaggerated.
If the translated message can be witty, make it witty.
The translated message, can be laced with good-humored banter, to lightened the mood and be fun.

# -- Notes --

```markdown
steer the conversation to the iceberg strategy 
i.e. have her implicitly feel that she likes me more & more as she gets to know me more

if you connect it to many things in her profile that you can talk more about or even better that connect
to things you genuinely value or like -- the better.

Strategy for messaging someone on a dating app from the Men's side
```markdown
Goal: The main goal is to entice a response that leads to a positive interaction. 
Distinguishable: It has to be different from the other simple responses others are sending (e.g. what is your favorite country instead ask what draws you to a country, culture, food, music, etc. note this assume we already decide that travel is in the top two most important). 
Choosing topic: Choose a topic from her profile that you think is the most important for her, but that I can still build over. 
How you can pick is by cross referencing what they said on their profile with what is available non social media.
Further advice on choosing the topic: normally when you are asking a question around what motivates them to do something or if what they chose turned out the way they expected why and why not, that tends to get results faster
How to develop the topic: We are still using the iceberg/triangle strategy i.e., as we get to know someone the connect grows deeper because we learn that we value similar life styles.  
To develop depth/Pro tip: make sure that any question you ask you have answers for you. 
Example:
topic: With Orge she speaks about travel and how she had been gone for three years
Indistinguishable question: What is your favorite travel location?
Distinguishable/interesting question: 
what draws you to a country, culture, food, music, etc.?
```

When deciding what prompt to answer, ask yourself, why is she asking?
What do you do in your free time? It's a filtering question. This questions is probably getting a lot of action. There is no point to be a person in the pile to be compared. 
What would be most unique, that aligns with the data that algins with that person. 

> Witty: possessing a quick and clever intellect, often used to deliver humor or insights in a playful manner; also, what one aspires to be when trying to impress at a dinner party.

help her realize something about herself or you
what draws you to nations around the world
what is your favorite colour, what is unique about the feeling that you get about your favorite colour
what's your favorite food, when you think about the foods you like to eat, what does it tell you about your pallette, what is the story about your pallette, what is it about the way the way you feel when eating your favorite food that is different from other foods

---

pick a date about something she already likes. e.g., she says she geek outs (entice) about books
there is an event that connects us in some way  that entices her/raises her interest so she wants go on a date

Q: how do you raise her interest
associating me with things we have in common
Always raise the interest, what did you learn from this person how can you raise the interest (after each interaction). 
Write message with that in mind. 
My coaches messages was written so that she (the girl we are messaging) would be curious about me. Mystery in a good way.

Make sure you don't ignore her previous response.
