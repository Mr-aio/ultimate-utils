# ---- Write good dating profile conversation starters ----


Note: seems you really have to come up with good messges yourself first unfortuantely.
See the ones I have, are all based on my or sim's insights first. 

#  Prompt: 
Provide me with different options for a high quality first message to a woman in a dating app
(e.g. Hinge Bumble Coffee and Beagles) using her profile prompts that I will provide:
```markdown
[//]: # (Her profile)
About Ala wang
Hi, I am a positive person who like to explore the things that I have not done before. üßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èI like to explore my inner self, so I have doing meditationüßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.And,I love the ocean üåäand the forest, üå≥where I can relax and recharge in nature. I also like to explore various foods ü•üüç§and enjoy be with my petsüê∞
```
Also consider my ideas or current attempted openers or ideas:
```markdown
[//]: # (My attempted openers or ideas)
Hi Ala, I'm reading altered-trait, a science meditation book and thought about you. Do you ever take mindfulness walks in the forest/nature? What is your favorite way to recharge?
```
The message should engage the women, especially start the conversation positively. 
It should not be: needy, overly exaggerated, pompous, confrontational or shallow.
It is fine if it's funny, witty, flirty (without overdoing it) yet mature and shows I'm a
stable independent man that is high value.
But most important is that it follow the iceberg or triangle approach to getting to know someone,
i.e. the message I write to her is connected to something about her in her profile, and ideally
invites us to get to know each other more -- especially making her feel implicitly that we like 
each other more and more as we get to know each other more.
This latter part is done because we wrote something connected to her profile yet. 
Also respect my guidelines and use my current attempts and ideas 
-- since that would ideally connect to things we might have in common. 
Connecting at a values level and having fun being lightweight or lighthearted or relaxed tone.
Do not compliment her in ways that sounds needy, be casual and relaxed, grounded.
It is also important that it's not too long, ideally concise and short, yet good.
It has to be 1 or 2 sentences -- max 3 sentences. 
Write my an interesting opener for her in Hinge, Bumble, Coffee and Beagles.
Give me 7 options:

# -- Notes --

```markdown
steer the conversation to the iceberg strategy 
i.e. have her implicitly feel that she likes me more & more as she gets to know me more

if you connect it to many things in her profile that you can talk more about or even better that connect
to things you genuinely value or like -- the better.

Strategy for messaging someone on a dating app from the Men's side
```markdown
Goal: The main goal is to entice a response that leads to a positive interaction. 
Distinguishable: It has to be different from the other simple responses others are sending (e.g. what is your favorite country instead ask what draws you to a country, culture, food, music, etc. note this assume we already decide that travel is in the top two most important). 
Choosing topic: Choose a topic from her profile that you think is the most important for her, but that I can still build over. 
How you can pick is by cross referencing what they said on their profile with what is available non social media.
Further advice on choosing the topic: normally when you are asking a question around what motivates them to do something or if what they chose turned out the way they expected why and why not, that tends to get results faster
How to develop the topic: We are still using the iceberg/triangle strategy i.e., as we get to know someone the connect grows deeper because we learn that we value similar life styles.  
To develop depth/Pro tip: make sure that any question you ask you have answers for you. 
Example:
topic: With Orge she speaks about travel and how she had been gone for three years
Indistinguishable question: What is your favorite travel location?
Distinguishable/interesting question: 
what draws you to a country, culture, food, music, etc.?
