Instructions to write a top quality discussion section for Machine Learning papers:
1. First (perhaps two/three) sentences: highlight concisely the main results, contribution and conclusion.
2. The discussion section should highlight the benefits, without exaggerating. 
3. The discussion section should discuss the limitations of the work in an honest (positive) way without diminishing your findings. Honest work is more trustworthy and thus more impactful.
4. Discuss the implications of the work and impact to the field of machine learning or relevant subfield. Connection to future work can be mentioned here.

One line summary for top quality discussion section: Discussion; Highlight key results and then proceeds to discusses implication (thus the work's potential impact), benefits, limitations, interpretations, compare with relevant literature, and future work (it can be connected to impact and implications).

Other useful points to keep in mind in the writing of the discussion:
- Make sure discussion sections prose flows well and logically.
- Use the active voice.
- Be concise, clear, and use precise language. If language is precise then it's more likely to be trustworthy since it's more likely to be objective. 
- Discussion sections should reflect critical thinking and evaluations.
- Although your discussion section discusses limitation, it should still make your work positive, persuasive and impactful.

Here is an example of a top quality discussion section:

\section{Discussion}
Our paper presents an alternative explanation for claimed emergent abilities of large language models. For a fixed task and a fixed model family, the researcher can choose a metric to create an emergent ability or choose a metric to ablate an emergent ability. Ergo, \textit{emergent abilities may be creations of the researcher's choices, not a fundamental property of the model family on the specific task.} We emphasize that nothing in this paper should be interpreted as claiming that large language models \textit{cannot} display emergent abilities; rather, our message is that previously claimed emergent abilities in \cite{brown2020language, ganguli2022predictability,srivastava2022beyond,wei2022emergent} might likely be a mirage induced by researcher analyses.

Our paper has several implications. Firstly, a task and a metric are distinct and meaningful choices when constructing a benchmark. Secondly, when choosing metric(s), one should consider the metric's effect on the per-token error rate and adapt their measuring process accordingly, e.g., if one chooses accuracy, one should make sure to have sufficient data to accurately measure accuracy to avoid the risk of drawing invalid scientific conclusions.
Thirdly, when making claims about capabilities of large models, including proper controls is critical. In this particular setting, emergent abilities claims are possibly infected by a failure to control for multiple comparisons. In BIG-Bench alone, there are $\geq$ 220 tasks, $\sim 40$ metrics per task, $\sim10$ model families, for a total of $\sim 10^6$ task-metric-model family triplets, meaning probability that \textit{no} task-metric-model family triplet exhibits an emergent ability by random chance might be small.
Fourthly, scientific progress can be hampered when models and their outputs are not made public for independent scientific investigation.

What are the best practices or advice for writing a top quality machine learning discussion section for a research paper
on the caliber of NeurIPS, NIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR, AAAI?

The discussion section of a machine learning research paper is crucial to comprehensively convey the implications of your findings, provide interpretations, draw conclusions, and outline potential directions for future work. Here are the best practices to write a top-quality machine learning discussion section:

Highlight key results: Begin by succinctly summarizing the most significant results of your research. State these results in the context of the objectives of your study. Highlight the advancements over the existing state-of-the-art methods. Provide statistics and results from your experiments to back these assertions.

Interpretation of results: Don't just state your findings, but also interpret them. Discuss why the results turned out as they did and what they mean in the context of your research question. Consider using visualizations to help explain complicated outcomes.

Compare with relevant literature: Discuss how your findings align or contrast with previously published studies. This comparison not only shows the novelty and significance of your research but also embeds your work in the larger academic discourse.

Discuss limitations: A transparent and objective discussion should include the limitations of your work. Every algorithm or model has limitations, and it's important to acknowledge these. Discuss the potential weaknesses of your methodology, data, or theoretical framework, and how these limitations could have impacted the results.

Implications of your research: Discuss the implications of your findings on the field of machine learning. This might include implications for theoretical development, practical applications, or broader impacts, such as societal or ethical considerations.

Future work: Identify areas for future research, whether it's improving the current model, applying the model to other problems, or addressing the limitations of your current study. This helps in setting the direction for other researchers who might be interested in your work.

Conclusion: Provide a concise conclusion that summarizes your main findings, their implications, and potential future directions.

Clarity and readability: The discussion should be written in clear, precise, and professional language. Be logical in your argumentation and make sure that the text flows naturally.

Remember that the discussion section is not merely a restatement of the results, but a comprehensive, critical analysis of the research findings, providing meaning and context to these findings.

so what is the difference between a conclusion and discussion section?
ChatGPT
In academic writing, the discussion and conclusion sections have distinct purposes and should contain different types of content.

Discussion: This is typically a detailed section where the results are interpreted and connected back to the original research question or hypothesis. 
It's where you can go in-depth into the implications of your results, compare them to other studies, discuss potential 
limitations, and propose ideas for future research. 
In essence, the discussion section is where you explain what your results mean in a broad context and in terms of your specific area of research.

Conclusion: The conclusion section is typically more concise and serves as a summary of your main findings and their implications. 
In contrast to the discussion, the conclusion should not introduce new topics or arguments. 
Instead, it should provide closure to your paper, summarizing the main points, reaffirming the importance of your work, 
and potentially indicating the wider implications of your findings. The conclusion is also where you can briefly mention
future directions for research, but without the detailed discussion and analysis that would be in the discussion section.

The distinction between these sections can sometimes blur, and in some papers, they may be combined into one "Discussion and Conclusion" section. 
However, even in this case, the roles of discussing and concluding should be clear in the text. 
It's also important to follow the specific guidelines of the journal or conference you are submitting to, as they may have particular preferences for how these sections should be structured.

Hi professor, 
Curious on your perspective. I find that main results & conclusions are often combined in the discussion section. 
Sometimes I'm not sure what the point of a conclusion section is if the conclusion is stated in the discussion section. What is your perspective in general? (with the caveat that the answer likely depends on the paper)
sanmi — 
Agreed, I think it's fine to combine. One usually does not need both.
