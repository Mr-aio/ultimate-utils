The formalization of existing mathematical proofs is a notoriously difficult process.
Despite decades of research on automation and proof assistants, writing formal
proofs remains arduous and only accessible to a few experts. While previous studies
to automate formalization focused on powerful search algorithms, no attempts were
made to take advantage of available informal proofs. In this work, we introduce
Draft, Sketch, and Prove (DSP), a method that maps informal proofs to formal proof
sketches, and uses the sketches to guide an automated prover by directing its search
to easier sub-problems. We investigate two relevant setups where informal proofs
are either written by humans or generated by a language model. Our experiments
and ablation studies show that large language models are able to produce wellstructured formal sketches that follow the same reasoning steps as the informal
proofs. Guiding an automated prover with these sketches enhances its performance
from 20.9% to 39.3% on a collection of mathematical competition problems.

Contributions:
• We introduce a novel approach to leverage informal proofs to guide automated provers with
formal proof sketches.
• To evaluate our approach, we build a dataset of manually curated informal statements and
informal proofs aligned with formal statements in the miniF2F dataset (Zheng et al., 2022).
• We increase the proportion of problems solved by an automated prover on miniF2F from
20.9% to 38.9% given language-model-generated informal proofs, and up to 39.3% when
proofs are written by humans.
• Through three ablation studies, we demonstrate the performance benefit of drafting informal
proofs, annotating sketches with informal segments, and using automated provers to close
open conjectures for the autoformalization of proofs.

Draft, Sketch, and Prove. Starting with an informal statement, our framework yields a formal proof
through a three-stage process: drafting informal proofs, mapping them into formal sketches, and proving the
remaining conjectures. Concretely, an informal statement is a mathematical problem described in a mixture
of natural and mathematical languages (e.g., formulae in LATEX). Then, we use a large language model to
autoformalize each informal proof into a formal sketch, which is a skeleton of the formal proof with open
conjectures left unproven (indicated by the <proof> blocks). The formal sketch mirrors the structure of the
informal proof. Finally, the open conjectures/gaps inside each formal sketch are proved by an off-the-shelf prover.

3 METHOD
In this section, we describe our Draft, Sketch, and Prove (DSP) method for formal proof automation,
which leverages informal proofs to guide automated formal theorem provers with proof sketches. We
assume that each problem comes with an informal statement and a formal statement describing the
problem. Our pipeline consists of three stages (depicted in Figure 1), which we present below.
3.1 DRAFTING INFORMAL PROOFS
The initial phase of the DSP method consists in finding informal proofs for a problem according to
its description in natural mathematical language (possibly with LATEX). The resulting informal proof
is seen as a draft for the subsequent phases. In mathematical textbooks, proofs of theorems are in
general provided, but are sometimes missing or incomplete. Therefore, we consider two settings
corresponding to the presence or absence of the informal proofs. In the first, we assume that a
“ground-truth” informal proof (i.e., one written by a human) is available, which is the typical scenario
in the practice of formalizing existing mathematical theories. In the second setting, we make a more
general assumption that the ground-truth informal proof is not given, and draft proof candidates
with a large language model trained on informal mathematical data. The language model removes
the dependence on human proofs and can produce multiple alternative solutions for every problem.
Although there is no easy way to automatically verify the correctness of these proofs, the

3.2 MAPPING INFORMAL PROOFS INTO FORMAL SKETCHES
A formal proof sketch encodes the structure of a solution and leaves out low-level details (Wiedijk,
2003). Intuitively, it is a partial proof that outlines high-level conjecture statements. A concrete
example of a proof sketch is shown in Figure 2. Although informal proofs often leave aside low-level
details, (e.g., by stating their triviality), these details cannot be discharged in a formal proof, making
straightforward informal-to-formal proof translation difficult. Instead, we propose to map informal
proofs to formal proof sketches that share the same high-level structures. The low-level details
missing from a proof sketch can later be filled by an automated prover. Since large informal-formal
parallel corpora do not exist, standard machine translation methods are unsuitable for this task.
Rather, we use the few-shot learning abilities of a large language model. Specifically, we prompt the
model with a few example pairs containing informal proofs and their corresponding formal sketches,
followed by an informal proof yet to be translated. We then let the model generate the subsequent
tokens to obtain the desired formal sketch. We refer to this model as an autoformalizer.
3.3 PROVING OPEN CONJECTURES IN THE SKETCHES
As the last part of the process, we execute off-the-shelf automated provers to fill in the missing
details in proof sketches, where “automated provers” refers to systems capable of producing formally
verifiable proofs. Our framework is agnostic to the specific choice of the automated prover: it can be
symbolic provers such as heuristic proof automation tools, neural-network-based provers, or hybrid
approaches. If the automated prover successfully closes all the gaps in the proof sketch, it returns the
final formal proof which can be checked against the problem’s specification. If the automated prover
fails (e.g., it exceeds the allocated time limit), we consider the evaluation to be unsuccessful


6 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we introduced Draft, Sketch, and Prove (DSP), a novel approach that takes advantage
of informal proofs to synthesize formal proofs. We demonstrated its feasibility and effectiveness
by reaching state-of-the-art performance on the miniF2F dataset with the Isabelle theorem prover.
Central to our method are formal proof sketches that mirror the high-level reasoning structures of
informal proofs. Our ablations showed that the ability to automatically convert informal proofs to
proof sketches is critical to the success of DSP.
Our DSP method differs fundamentally from previous applications of machine learning to formal
proof synthesis in two aspects. Firstly, while most approaches in the field focus on improving proof
search, our method seeks to construct the entire formal proof structure from the informal proof in one
decoding operation. The task of the automated prover is then simplified to filling the gaps between
intermediate conjectures. Secondly, while existing approaches operate exclusively on formal data,
DSP by design benefits from informal proofs.
In this work, we utilized a purely symbolic automated prover to close the gaps in proof sketches.
In the future, we aim to equip DSP with more powerful mechanisms, such as HyperTree Proof
Search (Lample et al., 2022), to broaden the scope of provable theorems. Similar to AlphaCode (Li
et al., 2022), we found that the number of generations is crucial for performance. The computational
cost of the autoformalizer being a bottleneck in our method, we seek to develop approaches able to
generate high-quality proof sketches more efficiently
