"""
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods enable efficient adaptation of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to various downstream applications without fine-tuning all the model's parameters. Fine-tuning large-scale PLMs is often prohibitively costly. In this regard, PEFT methods only fine-tune a small number of (extra) model parameters, thereby greatly decreasing the computational and storage costs. Recent State-of-the-Art PEFT techniques achieve performance comparable to that of full fine-tuning.

Seamlessly integrated with ðŸ¤— Accelerate for large scale models leveraging DeepSpeed and Big Model Inference.

Supported methods:

LoRA: LORA: LOW-RANK ADAPTATION OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS
Prefix Tuning: Prefix-Tuning: Optimizing Continuous Prompts for Generation, P-Tuning v2: Prompt Tuning Can Be Comparable to Fine-tuning Universally Across Scales and Tasks
P-Tuning: GPT Understands, Too
Prompt Tuning: The Power of Scale for Parameter-Efficient Prompt Tuning
AdaLoRA: Adaptive Budget Allocation for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
