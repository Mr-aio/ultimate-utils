"""
A very small p-value means that such an extreme observed outcome would be very unlikely under the null hypothesis.
- One sided (consider y is sample mean):
    p = Pr[Y >= y]

Decision Rule: https://online.stat.psu.edu/statprogram/reviews/statistical-concepts/hypothesis-testing/p-value-approach
    - If the P-value is less than (or equal to) alpha, then the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative
    hypothesis. And, if the P-value is greater than , then the null hypothesis is not rejected.
    - Set the significance level, alpha, the probability of making a Type I error to be small â€” 0.01, 0.05, or 0.10.
    Compare the P-value to alpha. If the P-value is less than (or equal to) alpha, reject the null hypothesis in
    favor of the alternative hypothesis. If the P-value is greater than , do not reject the null hypothesis.
