Notice that the debug() and info() messages didnâ€™t get logged. This is because, by default, the logging module logs the 
messages with a severity level of WARNING or above. You can change that by configuring the logging module to log events
 of all levels if you want. You can also define your own severity levels by changing configurations, but it is 
 generally not recommended as it can cause confusion with logs of some third-party libraries that you might be using.
